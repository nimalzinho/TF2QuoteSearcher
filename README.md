# TF2 Quote Searcher
Searching for quotes from the TF2 wiki can be annoying because voice commands, responses, taunts and audio previews aren't on the same page.

This is a simple site designed to help you with that. You can search for multiple words at the same time and after selecting the rows, get a summary of each file you need to do your sentence mixing.
